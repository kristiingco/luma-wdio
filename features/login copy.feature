#   As a registered user
#   I want to log in to my account
#   So that I can access my personalized settings and manage my account 

#   Scenario Outline: As a user, I can log into the secure area

#     Given I am on the login page
#     When I login with <username> and <password>
#     Then I should see a flash message saying <message>
